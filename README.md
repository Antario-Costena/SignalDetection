# Traffic Light And Signal Detection
In this project, we present a supervised method of **detecting trafﬁc-signs** completely based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We will use [Darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet), an open source neural network framework, and **Google Colaboratory**, a free environment that runs entirely in the cloud and provides a GPU.

## How to train and how to improve object detection
After loading the project [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H-IzMKJYn5LyHmEnwfml5stm814YWUBL?usp=sharing) on the drive, we have created a new Google Colaboratory session for training the neural network.
* in Colaboratory file, need to change the runtime type: from *Runtime* menu select *Change runtime* type and choose **GPU** as Hardware accelerator.

## 1 Configuration
In this section we will proceed to configure our Darknet network.
We will proceed to mount Google Drive on the Colab session.
```
from google.colab import drive
print("mounting DRIVE...")
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')
!ln -s /content/gdrive/My\ Drive/root_folder/my_drive
```
Now we will proceed to clone the [repository](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) , we're going to set some configuration parameters such as:
- [x] **OPENCV** to build with OpenCV;
- [x] **GPU** to build with CUDA to accelerate by using GPU;
- [x] **CUDNN** to build with cuDNN v5-v7 to accelerate training by using GPU;
- [x] **CUDNN_HALF** to speedup Detection 3x, Training 2x;

The next step is the compile.
