# Traffic Light And Signal Detection
In this project, we present a supervised method of **bold** detecting trafÔ¨Åc-signs completely based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We will use **bold** [Darknet!](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet), an open source neural network framework, and **bold** Google Colaboratory, a free environment that runs entirely in the cloud and provides a GPU.
